class FromOptionalDependency(object):
    """
    This is a utility class for importing classes from a module or
    replacing them with dummy types if the module can not be loaded.

    Assume module 'a' that does:

    .. sourcecode:: Python

        from b import C, D

    and module 'e' which does:

    .. sourcecode:: Python

        from a import F

    where 'b' is a hard to install dependency which is thus optional.
    To still be able to do:

    .. sourcecode:: Python

        import e

    without raising an error, for example for inspection purposes,
    this class can be used as a workaround in module 'a':

    .. sourcecode:: Python

        C, D = FromOptionalDependency('b').do_import('C', 'D')

    which is not as pretty as the actual syntax, but at least it
    can be read in a similar way. If the module 'b' can not be imported,
    stub-types are created that are called 'C' and 'D'. Everything depending
    on these types will work until any of those are instantiated - in that
    case an exception is raised.

    The exception can be controlled via the exception-parameter. If it is a
    string, a PlanktonException is constructed from it. Alternatively it can
    be an instance of an exception-type. If not provided, a PlanktonException
    with a standard message is constructed. If it is anything else, a RuntimeError
    is raised.

    Essentially, this class helps deferring ImportErrors until anything from
    the module that was attempted to load is actually used.

    :param module: Module from that symbols should be imported.
    :param exception: Text for PlanktonException or custom exception object.
